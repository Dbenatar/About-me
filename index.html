      <p>
        Hi, I am Dom. I am a professional chef wanting a career change into
        tech. This exercise and growth mindset as a whole makes me think about
        the first time I watched Jurassic Park (one of my favourite books and
        films) as a child. When found out that a lot of it was made using
        computers. Having no understanding of what that really meant, I just
        always put it down as the kind of thing I would never be able to learn.
        This year I have begun my journey into web development and while I have
        really struggled with some things, I have surprised and impressed myself
        when learning something new.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not a classically trained chef and have always learnt on the job.
        After many years I worked up to the level of "Sous chef" which is
        essentially the second in command under the head chef.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a previous life before I was a full time chef, I worked in the
        speciality coffee industry. I was essentially a professional coffee
        snob. I was previously employed as the head barista and coffee roaster
        for Cambridge based Coffee shop, Hot Numbers Coffee. After years of
        tasting and drinking multiple coffees a day, sometime in the excess of
        10. I now try limit that to 2 or 3 in the morning with a cut off of
        about 1-2 o'clock.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a number of years of giving my all to the hospitalty industry I
        was left feeling burnt out and wanting more from a career. Ive always
        felt somewhat tech savvy and learning web development has been
        challenging but really rewarding to learn something new. At the start of
        this year I began a Full stack web development course with Codecademy.
      </p>
