    <p>
      Hi, I am Dom. I am a professional chef wanting a career change into tech.
      This exercise and growth mindset as a whole makes me think about the first
      time I watched Jurassic Park (one of my favourite books and films) as a
      child. When found out that a lot of it was made using computers. Having no
      understanding of what that really meant, I just always put it down as the
      kind of thing I would never be able to learn. This year I have begun my
      journey into learning about coding and while I have really struggled with
      some things, I have surprised and impressed myself when learning something
      new.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not a classically trained chef and have always learnt on the job.
      After many years I worked up to the level of "Sous chef" which is
      essentially the second in command under the head chef.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a previous life before I was a full time chef, I worked in the
      speciality coffee industry. I was essentially a professional coffee snob.
      I was previously employed as the head barista and coffee roaster for
      Cambridge based Coffee shop, Hot Numbers Coffee. After years of tasting
      and drinking multiple coffees a day, sometime in the excess of 10. In
      recent times I limit that to 2 or 3 in the morning.
    </p>

    <p>
      After a number of years of giving my all to the hospitalty industry I was
      left feeling burnt out and wanting more from a career. Ive always felt
      somewhat tech savvy and learning web development has been challenging but
      really rewarding to learn something new. At the start of this year I began
      a Full stack web development course with Codecademy.
